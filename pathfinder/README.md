# PathFinder
PathFinder is a Java application where users can open an image, preferably of a map, and then mark nodes, or cities, and name them. The nodes can then be connected to other nodes where the connection (edge) has a name and a value. With Dijkstras algorithm the application can later on find the fastest way between to nodes. The nodes themselves doesn't have to be directly connected to each other. Just in some way through other nodes.
